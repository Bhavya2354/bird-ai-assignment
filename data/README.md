Dataset Source:
Images downloaded from Roboflow Universe – Chicken Detection dataset.

Usage:
These images are used to generate a fixed-camera CCTV-style video
by sequencing frames. The generated video is then processed for
bird detection, tracking, counting, and weight proxy estimation.

Note:
Public poultry CCTV video datasets were unavailable, so image-to-video
simulation was used without altering the core ML pipeline.
